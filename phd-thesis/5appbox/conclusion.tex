\section{Chapter Summary}

This paper presents \asd, a novel black-box app sandboxing solution for stock Android particularly suitable for enterprise domains, where apps running on employees' smartphones are often managed by specialised services such as MAMs and MDMs.  
\asd allows to monitor and if needed, also to enforce fine-grained security policies regulating the behaviour of a mobile app covering both Java components and native libraries, including those belonging to third parties.  \asd relies on its ability of running the managed app confined within an instrumented process space, while avoiding any modifications to its bytecode. This instrumentation is achieved  by runtime memory modifications. The instrumentation  allows full monitoring of Android Java APIs as well as native functions.  \asd reduces quite a lot the maintaining costs in comparison with those requested by customizable approaches. In such cases, the developer is asked to port app updates across all the managed apps, requiring time and financial efforts. Furthermore, a preliminary evaluation showed that \asd produces a limited performance overhead. Further tests have shown that the mechanism is quite robust and of general applicability to real apps and not only to toy examples. To allow other researchers to use and work with \asd, we have made available its implementation.
