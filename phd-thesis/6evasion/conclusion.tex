\section{Chapter Summary}
In this chapter, we presented a novel  mobile sandbox fingerprinting for the sandbox evasion by checking the usage profiles. As demonstrated by the evidence of collected results, usage profiles data could be used by a malware to fingerprint current sandboxes. We demonstrate that most of our analyzed sandboxes are built with fixed usage profiles and they completely overlook this potential hazard. Mitigations are provided by us to prevent such evasion hazards, e.g., different app runtime should present dynamically generated usage profiles, or hybrid usage profiles. Our research raises the alert for the usage-profile based fingerprinting hazard when developing mobile sandboxes and sheds lights on how to mitigate similar hazards.
